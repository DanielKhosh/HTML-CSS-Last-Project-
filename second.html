            <h3>Step one</h3>
            <p>the first step is to try to find out if the phone is available in your region or country.</p>
            <p>Not only that but it's also important to know which version the phone is available. This is because most smartphone manufacturers cannot produce all of the necessary parts by themselves so they rely on other companies to make them.</p>
